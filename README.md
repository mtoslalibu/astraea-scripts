# Cloudlab

- Please use the single-pc-ubuntu profile (i.e., https://www.cloudlab.us/show-profile.php?uuid=3a219420-9c4a-11ea-9203-e4434b2381fc to set up an experiment. From there, follow the steps in the setup.sh to pull neccesary repos (e.g., jaeger-client-java, java-spring-jaeger, java-spring-web, java-web-servlet-filter, and train-ticket), build their astraea versions, and finally run the application and astraea together.
